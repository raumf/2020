# 2020
2020 repository 

The following is just a reminder from First10's Instructions: 

We will provide read rights to the 2020 repo on github.

In order to make any changes, the repo needs to be forked to your own github account.
( Fork button is on github.com )

For every change or fix a new issue has to be created on github. Github issues should be given a short title and possibly a description.

Create a new branch from master ( Always branch off master as that is the codebase that is on the live site).The branch naming convention is as follows

issueid-followed-by-short-description 
ie 23-change-background-colour

Then check out the newly created branch and make the necessary changes.

Depending on how many changes are necessary the progress should regularly be saved. 
Add all file changes and commit with meaningful commit message.

After the commit the changes need to be pushed to github.

Once the change or issue has been completed, 2 pull requests have to be opened ( can be one via github.com )

1. From new branch into staging ( for testing )
2. From new branch into master ( for going live )

Part of the pull request should be instructions of any changes ( settings in wp-admin area, recompiling stylesheet etc ).

We will then review the changes, merge them first into staging for testing purposes and then finally into master forgoing live.
